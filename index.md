#### Analog audio circuit distortion unit, with digitally controlled quality-of-life improvements: presets, MIDI capabilities, customizables controls.
- Two independent distortion sources in parallel: 
    1- Feedback diodes, Tubescreamer-like soft overdrive
    2- To ground LED, Rat-like heavy distortion
- Three-band equalizer 
- Buffered input and output
- Up to 10 customizable presets
- MIDI communication, for preset selection and live preset editing
- Customizable boost functionality

#### Controls and connections
- 7 pots: Volume, Lows, Mids, Highs, OD gain, Distortion gain, Mix
- 2 footswitches: On/Off, Preset switching
- 1 button: extra functionalities
- MIDI In, Through

The board is realized in SMT technology to achieve the best noise performance and compact dimensions. The digital functionalities are managed by an Arduino board for the purpose of prototyping, while the actual unit will feature a standalone microcontroller.

#### Analog distortion unit, with two independent effect in parallel.
- Two independent distortion circuits in parallel: 
    1- Feedback diodes, Tubescreamer-like soft overdrive
    2- To ground LED, Rat-like heavy distortion
- Output is a mix between the two
- Buffered input and output

#### Controls and connections
- 7 pots: Gain, Tone, Volume for both circuits, Mix
- On/Off mechanical footswitch

The mix between two of the most iconic overdrive types is an insurance to obtain the desired sound. For the purists, the mix setting can be used in order to act as just one of the pedals alone.
